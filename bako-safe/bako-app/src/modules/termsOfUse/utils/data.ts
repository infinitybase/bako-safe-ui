      `In your use of the testnet, you may accumulate “testnet tokens,” such as through a faucet, which are not, and shall never convert to or accrue to become mainnet tokens or any other tokens or virtual assets. Testnet tokens are virtual items with no monetary value. Testnet tokens do not constitute any currency or property of any type and are not redeemable, refundable, or eligible for any fiat or virtual currency or anything else of value. Testnet tokens are not transferable between users outside of the testnet, and you may not attempt to sell, trade, or transfer any testnet tokens outside of the testnet, or obtain any manner of credit using any testnet tokens. Any attempt to sell, trade, or transfer any testnet tokens outside of the testnet will be null and void.`,

      `Bako Safe is a browser-based application that enables you, the user, to interact with the Fuel blockchain network without requiring you to disclose personal information (such as your name, email address, or other identifiers commonly required for software products). Instead of relying on traditional seed phrases, Bako Safe uses passkeys stored securely on your device or linked to an External Owned Account (EOA) wallet, such as Fuel or Fuelet.`,

      `When you first use Bako Safe, a passkey is created and securely stored on your device, or you can link an existing EOA wallet. Unlike seed phrases, passkeys are not manually managed, and Bako Safe does not have access to or control over them. It is important to ensure the security of your device and EOA wallet, as Bako Safe cannot recover lost passkeys or restore access to your account.`,

This data is sent by your device as part of standard HTTPS requests between Bako Safe and the backend servers that connect to the Fuel blockchain network (“Backend API Calls”).`,

      `In addition to incidental data collected through Backend API Calls, Bako Safe may also store and transmit certain telemetry data, crash/bug data, and other logs (“Telemetry Data”) to help ensure the quality and functionality of Bako Safe.
